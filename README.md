#### The three collaborators in this project are a trio of gamers and nerds. Two of us are fathers who want to produce something for our kids. The third among us wants something that can be extensible and fun to write for the long term.

#### We sought an environment of arcade limitations that allowed us to do anything we want. Thus, our stretch goals are the kind of things that you add one by one for eternity. This project is a design of passion more than anything. And we're glad you would join us.

#### The process to download right now is a google drive link and a little bit of work on a sideload [here](https://bit.ly/3zHo4QC). The long term aspiration is to update the game and push it to itch.io for free play.

> implemented features:
>> Enemy pooling<br>
>> Moneez<br>
>> Multiplayer interactions<br>
>> Violence against an infinite wave of foes<br>
>> Terrain<br>
>> Water<br>

> stretch goals:
>> Model selection for the user<br>
>> Updated UI for more beautification<br>
>> Animations, more models for enemies<br>
>> A weapon wheel<br>
>> A weapon vendor<br>
>> Building mechanics<br>
>> More of the island<br>
>> Many more<br>

#### A big thank you to the people who made our models a lot easier to put together and our game ship faster
